Hodor's Master namespace functions as a local proxy for the master (e.g. "Name node") of your target
Hadoop cluster.  The commands in this namespace either operate directly on the master node or
provide information about the cluster the master is master of. For example, to run a Linux command
on the master node:
\xt    $ hodor master:exec ps -ef | grep java

Part of the value of this namespace, it is allows you to operate on the master node, whatever that
may be. For example, regardless of whether you are targetting a staging or production hadoop cluster
(as configured in your "clusters.yml" file), the 'master:exec' command will route appropriately.
