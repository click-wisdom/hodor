YAML Processing Extensions

Variable back-referencing:
------------------------------

In order to reduce repetition in YAML property files Hodor has implemented variable expansion and back
referencing. How does this help? In normal YAML property file processing, there is no way to reuse values
within the same YAML file. For example, in the below YAML fragment, we are forced to repeat the string
"hadoop.vpc.acme.com" 4 times:

  :nameNode: hdfs://name01.hadoop.vpc.acme.com:8020
  :oozie_url: http://name01.hadoop.vpc.acme.com:11000/oozie/
  :hive_jdbc: jdbc:hive2://name02.hadoop.vpc.acme.com:10000/
  :hive_host: name02.hadoop.vpc.rgops.com

By default, YAML offers no means of reusing a common string. However, with Hodor's variable expansion and
back referencing feature, we can rewrite this YAML fragment with less repeatition:

  :hadoopBaseUrl: name01.hadoop.vpc.acme.com
  :nameNode: hdfs://name01.${hadoopBaseUrl}:8020
  :oozie_url: http://name01.${hadoopBaseUrl}:11000/oozie/
  :hive_jdbc: jdbc:hive2://name02.${hadoopBaseUrl}:10000/
  :hive_host: name02.${hadoopBaseUrl}

Wrapping a string in ${} indicates it is a back reference to a variable. It is a back reference because
the variable must be defined before it can be subsequently expanded. Attempting to expand a variable that
is defined later in the YAML file will fail to expand.

Back references can expand values defined at the same level or within a parent, using the '^' qualifier.
The '^' qualifier instructs Hodor to go up one level in the YAML hierarchy to find a value for the variable
example. More than one '^' qualifier is allowed, traversing up one more parent for each '^'. An example
that uses up reference ('^') follows:

production:
  :mysql_host: gamma-db-host.acme.com
  :mysql_port: 3306
  :database:
    :name: production_data
    :connection_string:  jdbc:mysql://${^msql_host}:${^mysql_port}/${name}

Note that the connection string has three variable expansions, two that include '^' qualifiers. Both
mysql_host and mysql_port are defined by the parent of connection_string, so the '^' qualifier causes
Hodor to look to the parent for values. On the other hand, the ${name} variable is defined at the
same hierarchical level, and therefore no '^' is required to locate its value.

More precisely, the ^ qualifier is used to specify which of the referenced versions of the property to
return if the property is defined at more than one level of the yml definitions.

In the YAML snippet below the property first is defined at four different levels:

:first: o1
:family:
  :first: p1
    :children:
      :first: c1
      :second: c2
      :third: c3
      :grandchildren:
        :first: g1
        :second: g2
        :third: g3
        :ggrandchildren:
          :first: gg1
          :second: gg2
          :third: gg3
          :fourth: gg4
:first_ggrandparent: ${^^^^^first}
:first_grandparent: ${^^^^first}
:first_parent: ${^^^first}
:first_child: ${^^first}
:first_grandchild: ${^first}
:first_ggrandchild: ${first}

The variables using back references would resolve to the following:
:first_ggrandparent => "first",
:first_grandparent => "o1",
:first_parent => "p1",
:first_child => "c1",
:first_grandchild => "g1",
:first_ggrandchild => "gg1"

This is because when a reference is found the application walks back uo to the root of the currently defined tree of properties then
walks down to the bottom of the tree collecting values for any properties with a matching key.  The values are stored from the
bottom up so "first" unqualified returns the lowest level property value, ^first returns the second lowest etc.  If there is no
match for the property at the specified level or there is not property with a matching name then the key is returned.
The first_ggrandparent is not defined so the key is returned.


This functionality in combination with simple yml processing makes it possible to reduce repetition and assure consistency in
.yml file definitions.  For example, a cluster file could be defined as follows

    :standardSuffixes : &suffixes
      :namePort: 8020
      :oozieSuffix: 11000/oozie
      :jobTrackerPort: 8050

    :templates: &templates
       :nameNode: hdfs://${^hadoopBaseUrl}/:${namePort)
       :jobTracker: ${^hadoopBaseUrl}:${jobTrackerPort)
       :oozie_url: http://${^hadoopBaseUrl}:${oozieSuffix)

    :production:
      <<suffixes
      :hadoopBaseUrl: hadoop-prod.mycompany.com
      <<: *templates

    :staging:
      <<suffixes
      :hadoopBaseUrl: hadoop-stage.mycompany.com
      <<: *templates

To verify property definitions in the clusters.yml file use:
    $ hodor master:print
